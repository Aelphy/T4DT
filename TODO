1. create TSDF with reasonable threshold - currently +- 0.05 due to the voxel size, is used. Upd 28.06.2022: asymmetric thrs are bad. Tried +- 0.5, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005
2. Share dataset - ping if needed, pure SDFs are 512^3 and take 0.5GB per frame, TTs of one scene is about 1Gb with rank 40
3. Baseline - blur
4. Add learning
