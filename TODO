1. create SDF fields 512^3 for the dataset - done for one scene, for more, probably, cluster is needed
2. create TSDF with reasonable threshold - currently +- 1 is used
3. Share dataset - ping aelphy if needed, pure SDFs are 512^3 and take 0.5GB per frame, TTs of one scene is about 1Gb with rank 40
4. Compare QTT with TT, Tucker
5. Baseline
6. rank / metrics sweep - currently only rank 40 is used
7. write the paper
